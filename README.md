This is only an experiment for front-end development (i.e. the function that allows randomization of what you get from the gacha, or how the gachapon dispenses when clicked).
In an ideal full-stack developed website, it would have a history of what you have gotten from the gacha, as well as how much currency you have to roll another try, and save it to a database server.
